## Summary

A quick overview of the number of reconciliations from the last month and how many clients you have assigned to Otto.

## Recent reconciliations

For each client you will see up to ten rows, relating to the ten most recent days when Otto reconciled at least one item for that client or made a decision on a SmartMatch reconciliation.

The columns show the number of each type of reconciliation that was made. If there have been any SmartMatch or GuidedMatch reconciliations, or skipped reconciliations, for that day you can click on the "View" link to see details of all the possible matches Otto saw that day.
