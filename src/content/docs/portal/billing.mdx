We don't want to send any surprise bills, so you can see what's going on with Otto and how much it is costing. The billing page shows how many reconciliations of each type have been made in each billing period and the cost, including any overage that will be charged at the end of the billing period.

## Detailed usage breakdown
To help you track and analyse your usage more effectively, you can download a detailed Excel spreadsheet for each billing period. Simply click the "Export usage breakdown" button to download a comprehensive report that breaks down your reconciliations by type, client, and day.

This report is particularly useful for:
- Monitoring which clients are using the most reconciliations
- Understanding usage patterns throughout the month
- Evaluating whether your current plan offers the best value for your practice

The spreadsheet automatically calculates the most cost-effective plan based on your current usage. You can also adjust the figures to forecast future usage and determine the optimal plan as your practice grows.

## Changing your plan
You can up- or downgrade your plan from the next billing cycle. You can also cancel, although we'd be sad to see you go and would love to have the chance to resolve any problems if you aren't happy with Otto.

## Fixed or uncapped billing
You can decide whether you want Otto to stop working when your included credits are used, or if you'd prefer him to carry on and be billed for the overage at the end of the month. See [fixed or uncapped billing](settings/#billing-type) in settings for more details.
