We don't want to send any surprise bills, so you can see what's going on with Otto and how much it is costing. The billing page shows how many reconciliations of each type have been made in each billing period and the cost, including any overage that will be charged at the end of the billing period.

## Changing your plan
You can up- or downgrade your plan from the next billing cycle. You can also cancel, although we'd be sad to see you go and would love to have the chance to resolve any problems if you aren't happy with Otto.

## Fixed or uncapped billing
You can decide whether you want Otto to stop working when your included credits are used, or if you'd prefer him to carry on and be billed for the overage at the end of the month. See [fixed or uncapped billing](settings/#billing-type) in settings for more details.
