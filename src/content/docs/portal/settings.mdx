We know every practice and client is different, so we want you to be able to use Otto in a way that works for you.

There are two levels of settings:

1. **Practice-wide** The place to set things up that should apply to all (or at least most) of your clients
2. **Client-level** Anything specific to that client

## Reconciliation settings

You can configure Otto's reconciliation settings at a practice-wide level and at the client level. There are similarities but also some differences between the two places.

### Practice-wide

#### Bank rule reconciliation

Bank rule reconciliations are enabled practice-wide by default. You would be the first to disable it for all your clients, but we won't judge!

#### SmartMatch reconciliation

SmartMatch is set to monitor mode when your trial starts, so you can check Otto's predictions before letting him reconcile green matches for your clients. Some practices are happy with only using bank rule matches, so disable SmartMatch. Maybe we're a _little_ biased, but we think SmartMatch is pretty great so recommend you give it a try.

#### Minimum SmartMatch confidence

This determines how confident Otto must be that the match is correct before he will reconcile it. It's only possible to increase the minimum confidence level at this level, which would reduce the chance of incorrect SmartMatch reconciliations but make Otto less likely to reconcile matches generally.

### Client-specific

These settings are very similar to the practice-wide settings. By default, clients will inherit the same settings that you apply practice-wide. For any clients that should have different settings, simply make the necessary changes. You can see what setting has been specified practice-wide.

#### Minimum SmartMatch confidence

You have a bit more flexibility with this setting for individual clients. The minimum confidence level is 70%. We recommend you monitor Otto's confidence for each client for a few weeks before lowering this setting to make sure you're not going to end up with extra work due to incorrect reconciliations.

## Scheduling

### Practice timezone

You might be thinking: _Huh? Why would I need to set this?_ Glad you asked!

Otto needs to make sure he's working when you expect him to, and your staff needs to know when to expect Otto to have completed the reconciliations. Some practices may have staff in different timezones and everyone needs to be on the same page about when the reconciliations will happen, so we have a default timezone and convert it for anyone who is somewhere else.

### Time

This is the hour of the day that Otto will perform reconciliations for you. Otto can start any time within the period and should finish before the end. We have monitoring in place to alert us if anything stops him from meeting this commitment so we can put fixes in place.

You can also see when Otto is next due to reconcile.

Otto keeps a watchful eye on your reconciliation schedule. If you change your preferred reconciliation time, he'll check each hour to make sure no reconciliations have been missed.

Let's say at 09:45 you change your daily reconciliation time from late evening (22:00-23:00) to early morning (06:00-07:00). When Otto does his hourly check at 10:00, he'll notice this gap and promptly catch up on any missed reconciliations. This ensures your books stay up to date, even when schedules change.

  Otto will reconcile a maximum of once per day

## Billing settings

### Billing type

Each plan comes with a certain number of included credits. These are used up when Otto reconciles matches in Xero. There are two billing types that give you control over your With Otto bill.

#### Uncapped

If Otto uses up all the included credits before the month ends, he will continue his work, and you'll be billed for the extra credit usage on your next bill. You will just pay the per-credit amount for your plan in this case.

#### Fixed

Ensure you never pay more than you have planned. Otto will stop further reconciliations once he has used the number of credits you have specified. He'll start again when the next billing period starts, and you get the next batch of included credits.

You can let Otto reconcile more than your included credits by specifying an extra credits limit. For example, if your plan includes 500 credits, and you allow 100 extra credits, Otto will stop until the next billing period if he consumes 600 credits.
