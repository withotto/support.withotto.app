## What you can update

- **Your name:** We use this in emails, so let us know if you'd prefer us to call you something else.
- **Email address:** Make sure any important emails from Otto arrive in the right place.
- **Timezone:** All dates and times in the portal will automatically be shown in this timezone, making it easy to see when Otto did something.

After updating your information, click the "Save" button in the bottom-right corner. If you need to return to your work without making changes, click "Back to dashboard".
