## The list
The place to go to see all the clients that Otto has seen in your practice and when he last checked them to see if he could reconcile anything.

## Details
This is where you can see everything Otto knows about your client.

The top section is a summary of what Otto has done, the settings that are applied, when Otto last checked that client, and when he was last trained.

Underneath is a table showing *every. single. reconciliation. ever.* (for that client at least.) We think it's important to see a full history of what Otto has done in each of your clients accounts so you can check back to see what happened, when, and why.
