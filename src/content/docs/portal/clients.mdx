## The list

The place to go to see all the clients that Otto has seen in your practice and when he last checked them to see if he could reconcile anything.

## Details

This is where you can see everything Otto knows about your client.

The top section is a summary of what Otto has done, the settings that are applied, when Otto last checked that client, and when he was last trained.

Underneath is a table showing _every. single. reconciliation. ever._ (for that client at least.) We think it's important to see a full history of what Otto has done in each of your clients accounts so you can check back to see what happened, when, and why.

## Manual reconciliations

Sometimes it might be helpful if Otto could reconcile a client outside your daily reconciliation schedule. Maybe you've just added a new client, created a bunch of new bank rules, or imported some bank transactions. Whatever the reason, you can call Otto to reconcile a client manually by clicking the "Trigger reconciliation" button.
