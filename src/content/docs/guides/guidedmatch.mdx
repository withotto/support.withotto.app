Particularly when he first starts in your practice, sometimes Otto won't be confident enough to reconcile a match that you want him to. GuidedMatch allows you to give Otto feedback to improve his performance in future whilst letting him reconcile the transaction in Xero the next time he reconciles that client.

Think of it like a bank rule: You've told Otto what the correct thing to do is, and he trusts you to get it right so follows your instruction.

<Aside>
GuidedMatch reconciliations are completely free so you're helping make Otto better in future and leaving the actual reconciliation to him. Win-win!
