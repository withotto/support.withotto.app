description: What you need to know about reconciling bank rules

Otto will reconcile any bank rules that you create. It's a great way to save time reconciling transactions that don't need the bill or invoice to be saved in Xero.

He isn't able to fill in any details, such as the payee or any references, so will skip any rule he finds that requires information to be added at reconciliation time.

<Aside type="caution">
  Make sure your bank rules only match the transactions you want to be
  reconciled. Otto cannot tell if you have made a mistake in the configuration
  and will trust it is OK to reconcile.
