Otto accesses your clients in the same way as a member of staff, or a subcontractor, would. All access is managed using Xero HQ. We create a unique Otto Xero account for your practice and will help you give Otto access to the clients you want him to work on during the onboarding call.

## What happens on the call
We'll provide details of how Otto works and what you can expect from him, including what he isn't able to do. You'll be shown the portal where you can monitor what Otto does each day and provide feedback on his performance.

The last part of the call is where we'll help you invite Otto to your practice and make sure he has the correct access to your clients.

## Post-call steps
There's nothing more for you to do until your trial starts but we'll begin training Otto on one year's worth of reconciliation data for each of the assigned clients. This is his starting knowledge to decide whether a bank transaction and a bill or invoice relate to the same payment.

## Otto's first day
Otto will only reconcile bank rules to begin with. This is to let you review his SmartMatch predictions to make sure you're happy with his work before you let him reconcile green matches. You can enable SmartMatch at any time, and even pick and choose which clients to enable it for.

You'll receive a summary email from us to confirm that Otto has started working in your practice and some tips for getting started with your trial.
