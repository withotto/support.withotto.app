We think of our trial like an all-you-can-eat buffet where you won't get side-eye for building a container out of food so you can pile as much as possible on your plate.

Here are the ~buffet rules~ trial suggestions:

<Steps>
    1. Add as many clients as you want

        We know Otto is a great fit for some practices and clients but he won't be perfect for everyone. Use the trial to see how he will fit into your practice and how he performs with a variety of clients.

        Like most, we're a price conscious practice so need to make sure we're getting value from the tools we pay for. The best way to get an idea of costs is to see what Otto can reconcile for any clients you are considering using him
        with and how much time you are saving.

    2. Enable SmartMatch

        Otto will only reconcile bank rules at the start of the trial. You will be able to see his SmartMatch decisions in
        the portal.

        If you're happy with the decisions Otto is making, enable SmartMatch. You can do this for all clients or a small
        numberâ€”whatever you're comfortable with.

    3. Give feedback

        Although the previous reconciliations from Xero are OK for Otto's initial training, he'll be more accurate with some
        feedback from you. We perform an extra re-training around two weeks into the trial so you can see the difference
        the feedback has made on his decisions for each of your clients.

    4. Ask if you have any questions

        We don't like pushy sales processes so we try to give you lots of space to trial Otto. We're available at `support@withotto.app` if you have any questions or need a hand with anything.
