Otto is like another employee (except he doesn't need a computer, a branded notepad, or annual leave) so accesses Xero using a web browser. His access is determined by you by inviting him to Xero HQ and assigning clients to him. You can add or remove clients at any time.

## Checking Otto has the correct access
With Xero's recent updates to the staff pages in Xero HQ, Otto now works best with the "Advisor" role. While this provides slightly more access than our previous recommendation of the "Standard" role, it ensures Otto can properly reconcile your accounts without requiring you to manually invite Otto to each client individually.

If you prefer to set a more restrictive role, you can follow [Xero's documentation](https://central.xero.com/s/article/Change-a-user-s-role-or-permissions?userregion=true) on viewing and changing user roles. You can check your clients' connection status in the portal - any clients where Otto doesn't have the necessary access will display a red padlock symbol.

View the client details page to confirm the role you should give him in Xero HQ.

## Assigning clients where you don't have manage users access
Your clients can invite Otto from their Xero organisation. We will need to accept the invitation before Otto will have access.

Here are the steps for your client to follow:

1. Visit your Xero account
2. Click the menu on the top left of the page
3. Select "Settings"
4. Select "Users"
5. Click "Invite a user"
6. Enter your practice's Otto email address. It will be something like practicename@works.withotto.app
7. Check "Business and accounting" but make sure the others are unchecked
8. Make sure the permissions match the screenshot
9. Click "Send invite"

## Assigning Otto to your practice
It's not possible to assign users access to a practice Xero account via Xero HQ. Here's what you need to do instead:

1. Visit your practice Xero account
2. Click the menu on the top left of the page
3. Select "Settings"
4. Select "Users"
5. Click the three dots on Otto's row, and select "Change permissions"
6. Make sure the permissions match the screenshot
