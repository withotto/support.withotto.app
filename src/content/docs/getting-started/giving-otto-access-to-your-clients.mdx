Otto is like another employee (except he doesn't need a computer, a branded notepad, or annual leave) so accesses Xero using a web browser. His access is determined by you by inviting him to Xero HQ and assigning clients to him. You can add or remove clients at any time.

## Checking Otto has the correct access
Like Goldilocks and her porridge, it is important that Otto has neither too much or too little access to your clients. You can check he has just the right role by viewing the [clients list](https://portal.withotto.app/clients/) in the portal. Any of your clients where Otto doesn't have the correct access will display a red padlock symbol.

View the client details page to confirm the role you should give him in Xero HQ.

    See [assigning clients](#assigning-clients) for steps to assign Otto the correct Xero role.

## Assigning Otto to your practice
It's not possible to assign users access to a practice Xero account via Xero HQ. Here's what you need to do instead:

1. Visit your practice Xero account
2. Click the menu on the top left of the page
3. Select "Settings"
4. Select "Users"
5. Click the three dots on Otto's row, and select "Change permissions"
6. Make sure the permissions match the screenshot
