Otto is like another employee (except he doesn't need a computer, a branded notepad, or annual leave) so accesses Xero using a web browser. His access is determined by you by inviting him to Xero HQ and assigning clients to him. You can add or remove clients at any time.

## Assigning clients

### Assigning clients where you have manage users access

### Assigning your practice Xero account

<Aside type="caution">
  Your practice transactions (salaries, fees, etc.) will be visible to staff who
  have access to all clients. To maintain privacy, ensure staff are assigned
  only to their relevant clients before adding your practice account.
</Aside>

It's not possible to assign users access to a practice Xero account via Xero HQ. Here's what you need to do instead:

1. Visit your practice Xero account
2. Click the menu on the top left of the page
3. Select "Settings"
4. Select "Users"
5. Click the three dots on Otto's row, and select "Change permissions"
6. Make sure the permissions match the screenshot

### Assigning clients where you don't have manage users access

<Aside>
  When your client hasn't granted you manage users access, you'll need to ask
  them to invite Otto.
</Aside>

Your clients can invite Otto from their Xero organisation. We will need to accept the invitation before Otto will have access.

Here are the steps for your client to follow:

1. Visit your Xero account
2. Click the menu on the top left of the page
3. Select "Settings"
4. Select "Users"
5. Click "Invite a user"
6. Enter your accountant or bookkeeper's Otto email address. It will be something like practicename@works.withotto.app
7. Check "Business and accounting" but make sure the others are unchecked
8. Make sure the permissions match the screenshot
9. Click "Send invite"

## Checking Otto has the correct access

Like Goldilocks and her porridge, it is important that Otto has neither too much nor too little access to your clients. You can check he has just the right role by viewing the [clients list](https://portal.withotto.app/clients/) in the portal. Any of your clients where Otto doesn't have the correct access will display a red padlock symbol.

View the client details page to confirm the role you should give him in Xero HQ.

  See [assigning clients](#assigning-clients) for steps to assign Otto the
  correct Xero role.
